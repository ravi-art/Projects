# crt file_name 

1. Create a file named 'file_name'.
2. If 'file_name' is already in use, then append (x) to it where 'x' is the lowest positive integer such that the file
   doesn't already exist. For example, 'crt a' creates file 'a(2)' if 'a' and 'a(1)' already exist.
3. Print '+ new_file' on a new line, where 'new_file' is the new file's name.

# del file_name 

1. Delete the file named 'file_name'.
2. Print '- file_name' on a new line, where 'file_name' is the deleted file's name.

# rnm file_name1 file_name2

1. Find the file called 'file_name1' and change the name to 'file_name2' (Follow point 2 of 'crt' command in case
   of conflict). For the purpose of simplification, you can think this operation as deleting the first file and
   creating the second file.
2. Print 'r file_name1 -> new_file' on a new line, where 'new_file' is the new file's name.

Given 'q' commands, execute each command in order.
